 *
 * Problem:
 * https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-133/problems/two-city-scheduling/
 *
 * There are 2N people a company is planning to interview.
 * The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0],
 * and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a
 * city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Though the problem is classified as easy, it a DP solution.
 *
 * Explanations:
 * First one -
 * How much money can we save if we fly a person to A vs. B? For the maximum savings, we should fly the person with the maximum saving to A, and with the minimum - to B.
 *
 * Example: [30, 100], [40, 90], [50, 50], [70, 50].
 * Savings: 70, 50, 0, -20.
 *
 * Obviously, first person should fly to A, and the last - to B.
 *
 * Commented on first one for further elaboration-
 *

     " The cost of sending a flyer to city B is relative to the
     cost of sending them to city A. If we send them to city B,
     then we have to send some other flyer to city A because we
     need N people in both cities. We could generally find the
     highest costs to B and send those people to A, but if they
     also have a high cost to A, then we didn't save much.
     Similarly, if we find the lowest costs to B and send those
     people to B, then we might not have saved much money over
     sending them to A - and meanwhile if that action caused us
     to send someone to A who cost us a lot more, we've lost money
     overall.
     Another way to look at it is that each person costs a certain
     amount to fly regardless of the city they go to, then they
     cost an additional premium to fly to one of the cities over
     the other. If their cost pair is [1000,1001] basically that
     person costs 1000 no matter what and we are only looking at
     saving or spending that extra dollar. We could reduce the
     solution by subtracting the minimum cost from both sides of
     each pair and then looking at optimizing the differential costs.
     That person's costs would then be fixed=1000, relative=[0,1].
     It produces the same answer, but it seems simpler because now
     everyone has a 0 (relative) cost for one city and a non-zero
     cost to the other. The solution at this point would be fairly
     simple - send the people with the largest differential costs
     to the city of their 0 relative cost, and then when you get
     the people with large differences assigned you end up with a
     lot of people with small differences, you keep doing this,
     saving less and less each time until you might end up with a
     bunch of people who all cost extra money to send to one city,
     but you've already assigned everyone you need to the other city.
     For example, the cost pairs [10,5], [10,7], [10,8], [5,10] could
     be made differential and you would get the costs fixed = [5,7,8,5],
     differentials=[[5,0],[3,0],[2,0],[0,5]] You know it will cost
     you at least 5+7+8+5 == 25 to send everyone, but how can you
     save the remaining costs? You obviously send the first person
     to city B and the last to city A and now you have one more for
     each city and the remainig differential costs are [3,0],[2,0].
     You can't send them both to city B since that would leave the cities
     improperly staffed, so you have to pick one to send to A and the
     other to B. Clearly you send the one that costs the least extra to
     send to A which is the latter of the two.
     Subtracting out the fixed costs really makes it rather obvious who
     to send where, you just sort them in the order from most costly to
     send to A, to most costly to send to B and then send the first half
     to city B and the second half to city A. It seems odd to have a
     dual-sort where one value is decreasing while the other is increasing,
     but since all cost pairs have one zero and one non-zero it is pretty
     obvious that the sorted order starts with the pairs that have a zero
     differential cost for B and they are in order of decreasing relative
     cost to send to A, then that is followed by all of the people who have
     a zero differential cost to go to A in the order of increasing cost to
     send them to B. It would look something like this:
     [10,0],[5,0],[3,0],...[0,2],[0,5],[0,100] It's pretty clear that the
     first person goes to B and the last one goes to A and choosing the
     first half of the list to go to B would minimize the relative costs
     for city B and the latter half would minimize the relative costs to
     go to A.
     But, you don't need to actually extract the fixed costs, you can do
     this with the original amounts just by looking at the difference
     between the numbers. Creating a bunch of relative costs just gives
     you a bunch of pairs of numbers were one of them is 0. If you subtract
     the A cost from the B cost, you get a single number that sorts the
     people by the relative cost to send them to B. You then send the ones
     with the highest relative B cost to A and vice versa.
     Thus the technique here, sort the list first by the B-A cost, then the
     beginning of the list (smallest values of "relative cost to send to B")
     are the ones you would rather send to B and the ones at the end you'd
     rather send to A."
