/**
 * Problem:
 *
 * https://www.codechef.com/wiki/tutorial-dynamic-programming
 *
 * On a positive integer, you can perform any one of the following 3 steps.
 * 1.) Subtract 1 from it. ( n = n - 1 )  ,
 * 2.) If its divisible by 2, divide by 2. ( if n % 2 == 0 , then n = n / 2  )  ,
 * 3.) If its divisible by 3, divide by 3. ( if n % 3 == 0 , then n = n / 3  ).
 *
 * Now the question is, given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of steps that takes n to 1
 *
 * eg:
 * 1.) For n = 1 , output: 0
 * 2.) For n = 4 , output: 2  ( 4  /2 = 2  /2 = 1 )
 * 3.) For n = 7 , output: 3  (  7  -1 = 6   /3 = 2   /2 = 1 )
 *
 * Solution:
 *
 * Approach / Idea: One can think of greedily choosing the step,
 * which makes n as low as possible and continue the same, till
 * it reaches
 *
 * 1. If you observe carefully, the greedy strategy
 * doesn't work here. Eg: Given n = 10 ,
 * Greedy --> 10 /2 = 5  -1 = 4  /2 = 2  /2 = 1  ( 4 steps ).
 *
 * But the optimal way is --> 10  -1 = 9  /3 = 3  /3 = 1 ( 3 steps ).
 *
 * So, we need to try out all possible steps we can make for each
 * possible value of n we encounter and choose the minimum of these
 * possibilities.
 *
 * It all starts with recursion :).
 * F(n) =   1 + min{  F(n-1) ,  F(n/2)  ,  F(n/3)  }  if (n>1) ,
 * else 0  ( i.e., F(1) = 0 ) .
 *
 * Now that we have our recurrence equation, we can right way start
 * coding the recursion. Wait.., does it have over-lapping subproblems?
 * YES. Is the optimal solution to a given input depends on the optimal
 * solution of its subproblems? Yes... Bingo ! its DP :) So, we just
 * store the solutions  to the subproblems we solve and use them later
 * on, as in memoization.. or we start from bottom and move up till the
 * given n, as in dp. As its the very first problem we are looking at here,
 * lets see both the codes.
