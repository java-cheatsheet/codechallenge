/**
 *
 * Problem: TODO
 * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/torque-and-development/problem
 *
 * Solution:
 * From going through the https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2 chapter 1,
 * It was clear that the problem number of non-acyclic edges in the graph and also
 * the number of components in the graph. Then if the sum of number of edges and the
 * number of vertices multiplied by their respective weights would give the answer.
 * The only issue is finding the number of acyclic edges, which I still need to think.
