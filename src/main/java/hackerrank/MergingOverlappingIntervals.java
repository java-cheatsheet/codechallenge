 Merging overlapping intervals

 You need to write a function that reads a list of intervals
 from STDIN, mergers the intervals that are overlapping,
 and write the resulting list to STDOUT.

 Lists of the intervals for both STDIN and STDOUT will be
 represented in a multiline format, with the number of
 intervals in the list on the first line(denoted N), followed
 by N lines, one for each interval. Each interval line is
 formed of two integers separated by a space, which are
 the beginning and the end of the interval.

 Example:
 If your function reads a list of intervals that contain (2, 4)
 and (3, 5), because those two intervals have an overlap
 they should be merged into a single interval (2, 5).

 Sample input:
 4
 0 1
 2 4
 6 7
 3 5

 Sample output:
 3
 0 1
 2 5
 6 7
