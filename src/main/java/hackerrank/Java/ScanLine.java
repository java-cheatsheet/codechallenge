/**
 * Problem:

    "In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source." â€” (Wikipedia: End-of-file)

    The challenge here is to read n lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all n lines of content.
    Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

    Input Format:
    Read some unknown n lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

    Output Format:
    For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

    Sample Input
        Hello world
        I am a file
        Read me until end-of-file.

    Sample Output
        1 Hello world
        2 I am a file
        3 Read me until end-of-file.
