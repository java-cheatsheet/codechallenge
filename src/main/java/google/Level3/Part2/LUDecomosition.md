**Lower–Upper (LU) Decomposition**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition
In numerical analysis and linear algebra, lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. Computers usually solve square systems of linear equations using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the determinant of a matrix. LU decomposition was introduced by Polish mathematician Tadeusz Banachiewicz in 1938.[1]

L U decomposition of a matrix is the factorization of a given square matrix into two triangular matrices, one upper triangular matrix and one lower triangular matrix, such that the product of these two matrices gives the original matrix. It was introduced by Alan Turing in 1948, who also created the turing machine.

This method of factorizing a matrix as a product of two triangular matrices has various applications such as solution of a system of equations, which itself is an integral part of many applications such as finding current in a circuit and solution of discrete dynamical system problems; finding the inverse of a matrix and finding the determinant of the matrix.

Basically, the L U decomposition method comes handy whenever it is possible to model the problem to be solved into matrix form. Conversion to the matrix form and solving with triangular matrices makes it easy to do calculations in the process of finding the solution.

A square matrix A can be decomposed into two square matrices L and U such that A = L U where U is an upper triangular matrix formed as a result of applying Gauss Elimination Method on A; and L is a lower triangular matrix with diagonal elements being equal to 1.
