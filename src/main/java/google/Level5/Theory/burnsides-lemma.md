## Burnside's Lemma 
It is a result in group theory that can help when counting objects with symmetry taken into account. It gives a formula to count objects, where two objects that are related by a symmetry (rotation or reflection, for example) are not to be counted as distinct.


## Polya Theorem
( Or the Pólya enumeration theorem or the Redfield–Pólya theorem or Pólya counting) 
It is a theorem in combinatorics that both 
follows from and ultimately generalizes 
Burnside's lemma on the number of orbits 
of a group action on a set.
