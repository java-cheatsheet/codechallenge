/**
 * Flatland Space Stations
 * Flatland is a country with a number of cities,
 * some of which have space stations. Cities are
 * numbered consecutively and each has a road of
 * length 1km connecting it to the next city.
 *
 * It is not a circular route, so the first city
 * doesn't connect with the last city.
 *
 * Determine the maximum distance from any city
 * to its nearest space station.
 *
 * Function Description
 * Complete the flatlandSpaceStations function in the editor below.
 *
 * flatlandSpaceStations has the following parameter(s):
 *
 *     int n: the number of cities
 *     int c[m]: the indices of cities with a space station
 *
 * Returns
 * - int: the maximum distance any city is from a space station
 *
 * Input Format
 * The first line consists of two space-separated integers n and m.
 *
 * The second line contains space-separated integers,
 * the indices of each city that has a space-station.
 * These values are unordered and distinct.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * 1 <= m <= n
 *
 * There will be at least 1 city with a space station.
 * No city has more than one space station.
 *
 * Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/flatland-space-stations/problem
 *
 * # Solution
 * The maximum distance any city is from a space station.
 *
 * Example 1
 * 5 2    n = 5, c[] size m = 2
 * 0 4    space stations
 *
 * There are five cities, c0,c1,c2,c3,c4.
 * c0 and c4 has space stations.
 * c2 has the maximum distance either to c0 or c4.
 * So maximum distance is 2.
 *
 * We only need to find the distances from those
 * cities which do not have the space station.
 *
 * Example 2
 * 6 6 n=6, m=6
 * 0 1 2 4 3 5
 * As all the cities have stations, maximum
 * distance from any city to a space station
 * is 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Pseudocode
 * maxDistance = 0
 * We have to calculate the distance for each
 * city to another, so we need two loops.
 *
 * for i=0;i<cities.length;i++
 *  for j=i+1;j<
 *
 * I think we just need to find maximum distance
 * between two stations, i.e. from a city to a
 * station between the stations.
 *
 * The distance from one (minimum) end point to
 * a space station.
 *
 * If there is only space station, calculate the
 * max distance from both ends.
 *
 * If there is only space station which is at
 * the either ends, get the distance from the
 * number of cities-1.
