# Pair Programming Session
## Problem
Rules:
1. You are given the initial starting point (0, 0, N) of a rover.
2. 0,0 are X and Y coordinates on a grid of (10, 10).
3. N is the direction it is facing (i.e. N, S, E, W).
4. L and R allow the rover to rotate left and right.
5. M allows the rover to move one point in the current direction.
6. The rover receives a string of commands e.g. "RMMLM" and returns the finishing point after the moves e.g. "2:1:N"
7. The rover wraps around if it reaches the end of the grid.
   1. The grid may have obstacles. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle e.g. "O:2:2:N" (O stands for Obstacle)

## Solution
Pass or create a grid.
Turn the rover
Move the rover - 
Update the current position - needs to be stored.
Cordinates

Move onestep

get the current position
