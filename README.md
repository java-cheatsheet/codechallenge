# Code Challenge

Code challenge solutions from different sources
in Java programming language.

## Objective

I want to improve my problem-solving 
and technical skills and keep my 
competitive edge by covering the core 
programming concepts and exploring 
further.

Listed below are few topics which
helps improve capabilities.

- Mathematics: Prime Number, Big Integer, 
Permutation, Number Theory, Factorial, 
Fibonacci, Sequences, Modulus

- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, 
Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Radix Sort, 
Bucket Sort

- Searching: Complete Search, Brute Force, 
Binary Search

- String Processing: String Matching, 
Pattern Matching

- Dynamic Programming: Longest Common 
Subsequence, Longest Increasing Subsequence, 
Edit Distance, 0/1 Knapsack, Coin Change, 
Matrix Chain Multiplication, Max Interval Sum

- Graph Traversal: Flood Fill, Floyd Warshal, 
MST, Max Bipartite Matching, Network Flow,
Articulation Point
 
*“For me, great algorithms are the poetry of 
computation. Just like verse, they can be terse,
allusive, dense, and even mysterious.
But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new
light on some aspect of computing.” 
— Francis Sullivan*

*“An algorithm must be seen to be believed.” 
— Donald Knuth*

*“I will, in fact, claim that the difference 
between a bad programmer and a good one is 
whether he considers his code or his data
structures more important.
Bad programmers worry about the code.
Good programmers worry about data structures and 
their relationships.” — Linus Torvalds*

*“Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.” 
— Niklaus Wirth`*

## How to become good at code challenges?

##### Understand The Basics
Don't skip basics, mathematics, data structures
and algorithms. Mathematics helps build a solution.
The data structures are the tools and the algorithms
are the techniques that are the arsenal that every
good programmer must have, more the better. Else,
you will only see `a hammer and a nail`.

##### Know The Process
To solve the challenge, start with trivial, slow
ideas to form a heuristic technique, and then
improve towards creative, fast algorithms which
could be solved with specific techniques. So just
solve as you can first even the exponential solution
if it works it's fine, be grateful.

Start by solving easy problems, then medium, and
finally the difficult ones. Try different types
of problems from different sources.

Learn from other's solution and compare with your
own. Try to understand what other did differently
and analyse what can be improved, both in your
solutions. This will help add more
dimensions to problem analysis and solutions ideas.

Improve your understanding by trying to answer
Why was it done this way?.

##### Estimate The Complexity
The time limit set for online tests is usually
from 1 to 10 seconds. We can therefore estimate
the expected complexity. During contests, we are
often given a limit on the size of data, and
therefore we can guess the time complexity within
which the task should be solved. This is usually
a great convenience because we can look for a
solution that works in a specific complexity instead
of worrying about a faster solution.

For example, if:
- n <= 1 000 000, the expected time complexity is O(n) or O(nlogn)
- n <= 10 000, the expected time complexity is O(n^2)
- n <= 500, the expected time complexity is O(n^3)

Of course, these limits are not precise. They are
just approximations, and will vary depending on the
specific task.
